Kristen James, PhD (she/her) is a Postdoctoral Fellow investigating genetic's role in dietary behavior under the supervision of Dr. Joanne Cole in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi) and the [Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/ccpm) at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Kristen received her PhD in [Nutritional Biology](https://ggnb.ucdavis.edu) with an emphasis in Genetics at the University of California, Davis where she applied translational approaches in healthy adults and Diversity Outbred mice to characterize the roles of diet, the gut microbiome, and genetics on the regulation of the metabolite trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), which is associated with cardiovascular disease. 

Kristen is inspired by the broad question, "what makes you, you and me, me?" and has long-term interests leading a research group that promotes precision health through data-informed nutrition, exercise, and pharmaceutical strategies. 

Kristen enjoys making art ("art-stagram", @kjsketch), exercising (skiing, hiking, running, lifting, cycling, playing tennis, golfing...), and spending time with friends and family.
